# S3mini | Tiny & Blazing-fast S3 client built for edge.

`S3mini` is ultra-lightweight (min ~14KB, +15% ops/s) TypeScript client for S3-compatible object storages. Running on Node, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, and edge platforms. It supports only a few S3 APIs. Tested on Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Storage, MinIO. (No Browser support)

## Features

- üöÄ Light and Fast: on average ~15% increase in ops/s and ~14KB in size (minified, not gzipped)
- üîß Zero dependencies, supports AWS Sig v4 (no presigned reqs)
- üü† Works on Cloudflare workers, ideal for edge computing, Node and Bun (no browser support)
- üîë Only essential S3 APIs (improved list, put, get, delete and a few more)
- üì¶ BYOS3: _`Bring Your Own S3-compatible bucket`_ (tested on: Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Storage, MinIO with Ceph and Garage in the queue)

## Supported Ops

The library supports a subset of S3 operations, focusing on essential features, making it suitable for environments with limited resources.

#### Bucket ops

- ‚úÖ HeadBucket (bucketExists)
- ‚úÖ createBucket (createBucket)

#### Objects ops

- ‚úÖ ListObjectsV2 (listObjects)
- ‚úÖ GetObject (getObject, getObjectWithETag, getObjectRaw, getObjectArrayBuffer)
- ‚úÖ PutObject (putObject)
- ‚úÖ DeleteObject (deleteObject)
- ‚úÖ HeadObject (objectExists, getEtag, getContentLength)
- ‚úÖ listMultipartUploads
- ‚úÖ CreateMultipartUpload (getMultipartUploadId)
- ‚úÖ completeMultipartUpload
- ‚úÖ abortMultipartUpload
- ‚úÖ uploadPart
- ‚ùå CopyObject: Not implemented (tbd)

## Installation

```bash
npm install S3mini
```

```bash
yarn add S3mini
```

```bash
pnpm add S3mini
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { S3mini, sanitizeETag } from 'S3mini';

const s3mini = new S3mini({
  accessKeyId: config.accessKeyId,
  secretAccessKey: config.secretAccessKey,
  endpoint: config.endpoint,
  region: config.region,
});

// Basic bucket ops
let exists: boolean = false;
try {
  // Check if the bucket exists
  exists = await s3mini.bucketExists();
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error(`Failed bucketExists() call, wrong credentials maybe: ${err.message}`);
}
if (!exists) {
  // Create the bucket based on the endpoint bucket name
  await s3mini.createBucket();
}

// Basic object ops
// key is the name of the object in the bucket
const smallObjectKey: string = 'small-object.txt';
// content is the data you want to store in the object
// it can be a string or Buffer (recommended for large objects)
const smallObjectContent: string = 'Hello, world!';

// check if the object exists
const objectExists: boolean = await s3mini.objectExists(smallObjectKey);
let etag: string | null = null;
if (!objectExists) {
  // put/upload the object, content can be a string or Buffer
  // to add object into "folder", use "folder/filename.txt" as key
  const resp: Response = await s3mini.putObject(smallObjectKey, smallObjectContent);
  // you can also get etag via getEtag method
  // const etag: string = await s3mini.getEtag(smallObjectKey);
  etag = sanitizeETag(resp.headers.get('etag'));
}

// get the object, null if not found
const objectData: string | null = await s3mini.getObject(smallObjectKey);
console.log('Object data:', objectData);

// get the object with ETag, null if not found
const response2: Response = await s3mini.getObject(smallObjectKey, { 'if-none-match': etag });
if (response2) {
  // ETag changed so we can get the object data and new ETag
  // Note: ETag is not guaranteed to be the same as the MD5 hash of the object
  // ETag is sanitized to remove quotes
  const etag2: string = sanitizeETag(response2.headers.get('etag'));
  console.log('Object data with ETag:', response2.body, 'ETag:', etag2);
} else {
  console.log('Object not found or ETag does match.');
}

// list objects in the bucket, null if bucket is empty
// Note: listObjects uses listObjectsV2 API and iterate over all pages
// so it will return all objects in the bucket which can take a while
// If you want to limit the number of objects returned, use the maxKeys option
// If you want to list objects in a specific "folder", use "folder/" as prefix
// Example s3mini.listObjects({"/" "myfolder/"})
const list: object[] | null = await s3mini.listObjects();
if (list) {
  console.log('List of objects:', list);
} else {
  console.log('No objects found in the bucket.');
}

// delete the object
const wasDeleted: boolean = await s3mini.deleteObject(smallObjectKey);

// Multipart upload
const multipartKey = 'multipart-object.txt';
const large_buffer = new Uint8Array(1024 * 1024 * 15); // 15 MB buffer
const partSize = 8 * 1024 * 1024; // 8 MB
const totalParts = Math.ceil(large_buffer.length / partSize);
// Beware! This will return always a new uploadId
// if you want to use the same uploadId, you need to store it somewhere
const uploadId = await s3mini.getMultipartUploadId(multipartKey);
const uploadPromises = [];
for (let i = 0; i < totalParts; i++) {
  const partBuffer = large_buffer.subarray(i * partSize, (i + 1) * partSize);
  // upload each part
  // Note: uploadPart returns a promise, so you can use Promise.all to upload all parts in parallel
  // but be careful with the number of parallel uploads, it can cause throttling
  // or errors if you upload too many parts at once
  // You can also use generator functions to upload parts in batches
  uploadPromises.push(s3mini.uploadPart(multipartKey, uploadId, partBuffer, i + 1));
}
const uploadResponses = await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
const parts = uploadResponses.map((response, index) => ({
  partNumber: index + 1,
  etag: response.etag,
}));
// Complete the multipart upload
const completeResponse = await s3mini.completeMultipartUpload(multipartKey, uploadId, parts);
const completeEtag = completeResponse.etag;

// List multipart uploads
// returns object with uploadId and key
const multipartUploads: object = await s3mini.listMultipartUploads();
// Abort the multipart upload
const abortResponse = await s3mini.abortMultipartUpload(multipartUploads.key, multipartUploads.uploadId);

// Multipart download
// lets test getObjectRaw with range
const rangeStart = 2048 * 1024; // 2 MB
const rangeEnd = 8 * 1024 * 1024 * 2; // 16 MB
const rangeResponse = await s3mini.getObjectRaw(multipartKey, false, rangeStart, rangeEnd);
const rangeData = await rangeResponse.arrayBuffer();
```

## Security Notes

- The library masks sensitive information (access keys, session tokens, etc.) when logging.
- Always protect your AWS credentials and avoid hardcoding them in your application(!!!) Use environment variables or a secure vault for storing credentials.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and perform operations.
- Be cautious when using multipart uploads, as they can incur additional costs if not managed properly.
- Authors are not responsible for any data loss or security breaches resulting from improper usage of the library.

## Contributions welcomed!

Contributions are greatly appreciated! If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a bug, we encourage you to get involved:

- _Report Issues_: If you encounter a problem or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. Include as much detail as possible (environment, error messages, logs, steps to reproduce, etc.) so we can understand and address the issue.

- _Pull Requests_: We welcome PRs! If you want to implement a new feature or fix a bug, feel free to submit a pull request to the latest `dev branch`. For major changes, it's a good idea to discuss your plans in an issue first.

- _Lightweight Philosophy_: When contributing, keep in mind that S3mini aims to remain lightweight and dependency-free. Please avoid adding heavy dependencies. New features should provide significant value to justify any increase in size.

- _Community Conduct_: Be respectful and constructive in communications. We want a welcoming environment for all contributors. For more details, please refer to our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). No one reads it, but it's there for a reason.
